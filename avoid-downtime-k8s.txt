Kubernetes - Liveness and Readiness

Kubernetes uses probes to check the health of a micro service
 • If readiness probe is not successful, no traffic is sent
 • If liveness probe is not successful, pod is restarted

Spring Boot Actuator (>=2.3) provides inbuilt readiness and liveness probes
 • /health/readiness     
 • /health/liveness
