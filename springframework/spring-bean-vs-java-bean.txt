JavaBeans:
At a basic level, JavaBeans are simply Java classes which adhere to certain coding conventions. Specifically, classes that

- have public default (no argument) constructors
- allow access to their properties using accessor (getter and setter) methods
- implement java.io.Serializable


Spring Beans:
A Spring bean is basically an object managed by Spring. More specifically, it is an object that is instantiated, configured and otherwise managed by a Spring Framework container. Spring beans are defined in Spring configuration files (or, more recently, with annotations), instantiated by Spring containers, and then injected into applications.

Note*: that Spring beans need not always be JavaBeans. Spring beans might not implement the java.io.Serializable interface, can have arguments in their constructors, etc.
