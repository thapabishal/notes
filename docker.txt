### Docker
Docker is a container management tool. It helps to pack application and all its dependencis together.
It makes a easy and efficient containrized deployments. 

### Hypervisor
A hypervisor is a sfotware that makes virtualization possible. It divided the host system and allocates the resouces to each divided virtual environment.
Basically it makes it possible to run multiple OS on a single host system. 

There are two types of hypervisor:
- Type 1 Hypervisor (Native/Bare Metal Hypervisor)
  It runs directly in the underlying hardware. It does not require base operating system. This is used in producation.

- Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor)
  This hypervisor is installed on the top of host operating system. It is also called hosted hypervisor

### Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of creating a software based, virtual version of something like network resource, storage resourece or computing resource.
Virtulization lets split one system into many different section which act like separate individual systems.

### Containerization
Containerization is packing software code with all it's necessary components like libraries, framework together in a isolation.
Container is fully packed and portable. 

### Difference between virtualization and containerization
Containers provide an isolated environment for running the application. The entire user space is explicitly dedicated to the application. 
Any changes made inside the container is never reflected on the host or even other containers running on the same host.
Containers are an abstraction of the application layer. Each container is a different application.

Whereas in Virtualization, hypervisors provide an entire virtual machine to the guest(including Kernal).
 Virtual machines are an abstraction of the hardware layer. Each VM is a physical machine.
